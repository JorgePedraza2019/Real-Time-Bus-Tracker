# Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker
## Description of the project:
#### What the project does is track the bus automatically when the track button is clicked. The improvement that was made was in the style of the map since the satellite view map was placed.

## How to Run:
#### To run the project, it must first be downloaded and the index.html file must be opened with the browser. It should be noted that for the project to work correctly, the key must be added to the mapanimation.js file, which is obtained by generating a MapBox account on the following page: https://www.mapbox.com/

## Roadmap of future improvements:
#### The improvements that can be applied to the map is that it leaves a trace in a line on the coordinates where the bus passed.
